# Evoloom

For Environment setup you will need yarn.
To get this if you don't use it already, run:

`npm install --global yarn`

after this no more npm cuz npm blows and yarn is faster.

to run the environment you can just run

`yarn expo`  

the script in package.json will handle starting it up. then just pull up your expo go app (on the same weefee network) and you should be able to pull it up
